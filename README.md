<h2>My Experience</h2>

I learnt how to use Slack app using this program which is used by industry. Also during this program I got to explore git more.
I got to learn about the flask basics and how I can connect my app to database. Also during this program I improved my HTML-CSS basics and learnt how to build a header and a footer. I now know how to deploy my applications on Heroku anytime. Also this program got me excited with Flask development. I never had thought I could enjoy this veyr much. I am grateful that I got this oppportunity to be part of this program
